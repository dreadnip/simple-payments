# Mollie course payments

This is an example integration where the Mollie PHP SDK is used to accept payment for a simple course sign-up page, hosted in a single PHP file.

An SQLite database holds the order data. phpdotenv is used to hold the Mollie API key.

Can easily be expanded to work with a mailing service like Mailgun to send confirmation mails.
